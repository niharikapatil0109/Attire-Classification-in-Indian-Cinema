# Attire-Classification-in-Indian-Cinema
This project introduces an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for analyzing attire trends in Indian cinema. Using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Dlib, the system automates frame extraction, face detection, and attire classification. Fine-tuned vision-language models like LLaVA enable robust binary classification (Indian vs. Western) across more than 100 full-length films, despite variations in frame quality, lighting, and poses. The pipeline also performs statistical trend analysis, revealing cultural representation shifts, with attire proportions ranging from 0.28% to 99.27% in films released between 1991 and 2020.
