# Attire-Classification-in-Indian-Cinema
Our work presents a machine-learning pipeline using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Dlib to automate frame extraction, face detection, and attire classification in films. By fine-tuning models like LLaVA, we analyzed 100+ movies and quantified cultural shifts in Indian vs. Western attire from 1991–2020.
